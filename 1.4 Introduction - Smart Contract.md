Smart Contract was first proposed by Nick Szabo in 1994, who described it as “a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises”.

The idea hasn't received commercial adoption due to lack of trustworthy execution environment, until the appearance of blockchain technology. Released in 2015, Ethereum implements a nearly Turing-complete language on its blockchain, a prominent smart contract framework. The Ethereum white paper describes smart contracts as “cryptographic boxes contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met". It also lists financial derivatives as the most common application of a smart contract, and introduces a rough idea about creating stable-value currencies through a hedging contract.

Up until now, the most popular stablecoin solution has been issuer-backed assets. And it is almost a market consensus that such issuers are not always trustworthy. We agree with Ethereum authors' argument that, a decentralized market of speculators and arbitragers powered by smart contract, could be an alternative solution.

The intent of this paper is to propose an alternative approach of creating stable value tokens, providing a different set of tradeoffs between price stability, holder incentive and supply flexibility. We believe the solution will be very useful for broader adoption of the crypto market.
