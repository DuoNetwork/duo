Simply put, the holders of Class B tokens borrow capital from the holders of Class A tokens and invest in a volatile asset (i.e. ETH), which leads the Class B token to possess a continuum of leverage ratios. To reduce risk of both classes, a set of upward and downward reset clauses is imposed.

Upward Reset

When ETH/USD price rises, the Class B token's leverage ratio reduces. An Upward Reset is triggered when the Net Value of Class B token reaches upper limit H. The reset will restore the leverage ratio to 200%, and the Net Value of both classes to 1 USD. By increasing Class B's leverage ratio, the structure retains attraction to leverage-seeking users.

Upon Upward Reset, both classes' holders will receive certain amount of ETH from the Custodian contract.

The ETH amount E(A) for each Class A token and E(B) for each Class B token:

    E(A) = (NV(A) - 1) / P(t)
    E(B) = (NV(B) - 1) / P(t)

    NV(A) is the Net Value of Class A token at current reset time.
    
    NV(B) is the Net Value of Class B token at current reset time.
    
    P(t) is the ETH/USD price at current reset point.

Downward Reset

When ETH/USD price falls, the Class B token's leverage ratio increases. A Downward Reset is triggered when the Net Value of Class B token reaches lower limit h. Similar to an Upward Reset, a Downward Reset restores the leverage ratio and Net Value of both classes. By reducing leverage ratio and restoring Net Value, the structure strengtherns principal protection to Class A holders.

Class A holder will receive certain amount of ETH from the Custodian contract. Additionally, A Downward Reset will reduce the total supply of Class A and Class B tokens by roughly 1 - h. 

The ETH amount E(A) of each Class A token is:

    E(A) = (NV(A) - NV(B)) / P(t)

    NV(A) is the Net Value of Class A token right before the Downward Reset.

    NV(B) is the Net Value of Class B token right before the Downward Reset.

The post-reset amount of Class A and Class B tokens will be calculated as:

    Q(t+) = Q(t-) * NV(B)

    Q(t+) is the amount of Class A and Class B tokens right after the Downward Reset.

    Q(t-) is the amount of Class A and Class B tokens right before the Downward Reset.
