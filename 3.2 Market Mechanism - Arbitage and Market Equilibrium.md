The dual class tokens are two-way fungible to the underlying token (i.e. ETH). Thus, a price parity shall hold as below:

    alpha * P(A, t) + P(B, t) = alpha * V(A, t) + V(B, t)

    where:
    P(A, t) is the fair price of Class A token at time t
    P(B, t) is the fair price of Class B token at time t

    Along with equation Creation and Redemption in section 2.2, below should hold:

    (1 + alpha) * P(t) / P(0) * (1 - c) <= alpha * P(A, t) + P(B, t) <= (1 + alpha) * P(t) / P(0) / (1 - c)

On open market, arbitrage opportunity exists when Class A and Class B tokens trade away from their net values and above equation is violated on either side.

Arbitrage via Creation

exists when

    alpha * P(A, t) + P(B, t) > (1 + alpha) * P(t) / P(0) / (1 - c)

When combined market price of Class A and Class B tokens are higher than their combined net values, an user can exploit the profit by creating more DUO tokens. In particular:

1) Buy X / (1-c) underlying tokens from open market for X / (1 - c) * P(t).
2) Send the underlying tokens to the Custodian contract.
3) Based on equation Creation, receive X * P(0) * alpha / (1 + alpha) Class A and X * P(0) / (1 + alpha) Class B tokens.
4) Sell Class A and Class B tokens on open market for X * P(0) * P(A, t) * alpha / (1 + alpha) + X * P(0) * P(B, t) / ( 1 + alpha).

The expected payoff of above operations is:

    X * P(0) * P(A, t) * alpha / (1 + alpha) + X * P(0) * P(B, t) / (1 + alpha) - X / (1 - c) * P(t) 
    = X * P(0) / (1 + alpha) * (alpha * P(A, t) + P(B, t) - (1 + alpha) * P(t) / P(0) / (1 - c)) 
    > 0 


This procedure will increase the supply of dual class tokens on open market and provide a downward pressure on their market prices, thus bring the market back to equilibrium.

Arbitrage via Redemption

exists when

    (1 + alpha) * P(t) / P(0) * (1 - c) > alpha * P(A, t) + P(B, t)

When combined market price of Class A and Class B tokens are lower than their combined net values, similar arbitrage profit can be exploited by perform redemptions:

1) Buy X * P(0) * alpha / (1 + alpha) Class A and X * P(0) / (1 + alpha) Class B tokens from open market for total of X * P(0) * P(A, t) * alpha / (1 + alpha) + X * P(0) * P(B, t) / ( 1 + alpha).
2) Send Class A and Class B tokens to the Custodian contract
3) Based on equation Redemption, receive X * (1 - c) underlying tokens.
4) Sell underlying tokens on open market for X * (1 - c) * P(t).

The expected payoff of above operations is:
    X * (1 - c) * P(t) - X * P(0) * P(A, t) * alpha / (1 + alpha) - X * P(0) * P(B, t) / ( 1 + alpha) 
    = X * P(0) / (1 + alpha) * ((1 + alpha) * P(t) / P(0) * (1 - c) - alpha * P(A, t) - P(B, t)) 
    > 0

This procedure will reduce the market supply of dual class tokens and provide a upward push to their market prices toward market equilibrium.

Many other factors also determine whether above arbitrage strategy can be successfully executed, such as bid ask spread of all the 3 components, abilility to short sell the required components.
