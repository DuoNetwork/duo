The dual class tokens are two-way fungible to the underlying token (i.e. ETH). Thus, a price parity shall hold as below:

    alpha * P(A, t) + P(B, t) = alpha * V(A, t) + V(B, t)

    where:
    P(A, t) is the fair price of Class A token at time t
    P(B, t) is the fair price of Class B token at time t
    V(A, t) is the net value of Class A token at time t
    V(B, t) is the net value of Class A token at time t

    By applying Formula **:

    alpha * P(A, t) + P(B, t) = (1 + alpha) * P(t) / P(0)

On open market, arbitrage opportunity existsboth Class A and Class B tokens might be traded away from their net values. 

Arbitrage via Creation

When combined market price of Class A and Class B tokens are higher than their combined net values, an user can exploit the profit by creating more DUO tokens. In particular:

1) Buy X underlying tokens from open market.
2) Send the underlying tokens to the Custodian contract and receive N Class A and M Class B tokens.
3) Sell Class A and Class B tokens on open market.

The expected payoff of above operations is:

    blah blah blah


This procedure will increase the supply of dual class tokens on open market and provide a downward pressure on their market prices, thus bring the market back to equilibrium.

Arbitrage via Redemption

When combined market price of Class A and Class B tokens are lower than their combined net values, similar arbitrage profit can be expoited by perform redemptions:

1) Buy Class A and Class B tokens from open market.
2) Send the dual class tokens to the Custodian contract and receive undelrying tokens.
3) Sell underlying tokens on open market.

This procedure will reduce the market supply of dual class tokens and provide a upward push to their market prices toward market equilibrium.

Many other factors also determine whether above arbtrage strategy can be successfully exeucted, such as bid ask spread of all the 3 components, Creation and Redemption cost as mentioned in 2.2, abilility to short sell the required components.
