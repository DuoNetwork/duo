By definition, DUO is equivalent to the underlying, ETH in this case. Thus, its price SHOULD be the same as ETH. On the other hand, DUO is not traded directly in the market but split as equal amounts of Class A and Class B. As discussed in previous section, Class A can trade on premium or at discount depending on market condition. The same applies for Class B as market fluctates. When the combined value of Class A and Class B does not equal ETH, arbitrage opportunity exists. 

Arbitrage via Creation

When both Class A and Class B trades on premium, 

1) Sell 1 unit of Class A and 1 unit of Class B and Buy 1 unit of underlying token
2) Send 1 unit of underlying token to smart contract and receive 1 unit of Class A and 1 unit of Class B

Arbitrage via Redemption

When both Class A and Class B trades at discount, 

1) Buy 1 unit of Class A and 1 unit of Class B and Sell 1 unit of underlying token
2) Send 1 unit of Class A and 1 unit of Class B to smart contract and receive 1 unit of underlying token

Many other factors also determine whether above arbtrage strategy can be successfully exeucted, such as bid ask spread of all the 3 components, Creation and Redemption cost as mentioned in 2.2, abilility to short sell the required components.
