Major crypto-currencies are subject to massive volatility, which makes them attractive to speculators but unsuitable for mainstream use. There have been several attempts on implementing 'stablecoins'. But most of them fail to provide steady returns that's appealing to regular investors.

Inspired by the dual purpose fund that has gained popularity in the US and China, we propose, for the first time to our best knowledge, a dual-class crypto token structure that offers entitlements to either fixed income or leveraged capital appreciation: the income token receives periodical coupon payments with principal protection; the leverage token provides leveraged participation in underlying crypto assets. The whole mechanism is governed by smart contracts run on Ethereum blockchain, without dealing with centralized counterparties. In theory, we justify the income token as an ideal stable token.

For illustration, we employ Ether (ETH) as underlying asset and use its historical prices to demonstrate  the performance of our stable token in real world scenarios. We also show how arbitrage activities take place and help maintain price stability of this stable token.
