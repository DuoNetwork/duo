Major crypto-currencies are subject to massive volatility, which makes them attractive to speculators but unsuited for mainstream use. There has been several attempts on implementing 'stablecoins'. But most of them fail to provide steady returns that's appealing to regular investors.

We propose, for the first time to our best knowledge, a dual-class token structure that offers entitlements to either fixed income or leveraged capital appreciation: the income token receives periodical coupon payments with principal protection; the leverage token provides leveraged participation in underlying crypto assets. The whole mechanism is governed by smart contracts run on Ethereum blockchain, without dealing with centralized counterparties.

We further explain on: 1) why fixed income tokens are essential to crypto asset allocation; 2) how similar dual purpose products were developed and accepted in mature financial markets; 3) how market equilibrium can be achieved through arbitrage activities; and 4) how we will implement this structure through KINE, a decentralized asset management platform.
