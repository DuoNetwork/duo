Major crypto-currencies are subject to massive volatility, which makes them attractive to speculators but unsuited for mainstream use. There has been several attempts on implementing 'stablecoins'. But most of them fail to provide steady returns that's appealing to regular investors.

Dual purpose fund is a leverage investment product that has gained popularity in the US and China. It provides a practical risk segregation design based on a single underlying asset, which is especially suitable for creating fixed income assets in crypto market.

We propose, for the first time to our best knowledge, a dual-class crypto token structure that offers entitlements to either fixed income or leveraged capital appreciation: the income token receives periodical coupon payments with principal protection; the leverage token provides leveraged participation in underlying crypto assets. The whole mechanism is governed by smart contracts run on Ethereum blockchain, without dealing with centralized counterparties.

We take Ether (ETH) as underlying asset and use historical prices to illustrate the product's performance in real world scenarios. And we further explain on how arbitrage activities take place and help maintain price stability of the income tokens.
