This paper has outlined the main design and market mechanism for the structure. Further study is still requred for below aspects.

Base Rate Discovery

Arbitrary rate can be used for Class A coupon and it will be traded on premiumn or at discount based on the market required rate of return, However, it is desirable that Class A trades close to its net value, which means the coupon rate for Class A should be chosen close to market required rate of return. Currently there are a few rates in the market, such as USD borrowing cost in a few centralized exchanges ranging from 20% to over 40% per annun.

Optimal Reset Threshold and Frequency

It is important to keep leverage for Class B within certain range: not too high so as to protect Class A holders from sudden price drop and not too low so as to keep Class B attractive to leveraged investors. However, it is undesirable that resets happen too frequent. 

Other Coin Based Structure

While the structure discussed in this paper is indepenent to the underlying cryptocurrency, the liquidity and popularity of the underlying does impact the viability of the structure as market arbitrage is important to ensure the structure trades as designed. In this paper, ETH is used as example, but other popular ERC20 coins such as EOS, QTUM can also be considered.
