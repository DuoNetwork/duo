Creation

Dual-class tokens can be created by depositing underlying tokens to the Custodian contract. Upon receiving underlying tokens, the Custodian contract will return to the sender certain amount of Class A and Class B tokens. Such amount N(C) can be calculated by:

    C(A) = M(C) * P(0) * (1 - c) * alpha / (1 + alpha)

    C(B) = M(C) * P(0) * (1 - c) / (1 + alpha)

    M(C) is the amount of underlying tokens sent to the Custodian contract.

    c is the processing fee of the smart contract,

    alpha is a positive number for determine the ratio of A and B,

    P(0) is the recorded price of underlying token in USD at last Reset event.

The deposited underlying tokens are kept by the Custodian contract, as collateral of the Class A and Class B tokens issued by the contract. Any user or member of the public can verify the collateral and tokens issued through third party applications such as Etherscan.io.

Redemption

Holders of Class A and Class B tokens can withdraw deposited underlying tokens at any time by performing a redemption. To do this, the user will send certain amount of Class A and Class B tokens to the Custodian contract. The contract will deduct Class A and Class B tokens, and return return to the sender certain amount of underlying tokens. 

The amount R(A) and R(B) deducted by the contract is:

    R = Min (M(A) / alpha, M(B))

    R(A) = R * alpha

    R(B) = R 

    M(A) is the amount of Class A sent to the Custodian contract.

    M(B) is the amount of Class B sent to the Custodian contract.

The amount M(R) returned by the contract is:

    M(R) = R * (1 - c) * (1 + alpha) / P(0)

Net Value

The net value of tokens are calculated based on the coupon rate, the elapsed time from last Reset event, and the latest underlying token price in USD fed to the system. In particular:

​	V(A, t) = 1 + r * t

​	V(B, t) = (1 + alpha) * P(t) / P(0) - alpha * V(A, t)

​	r is the daily coupon rate.

​	t is the number of days from last Reset event.

​	P(t) is the current price of underlying token in USD.

Implied Leverage ratio

   L(B, 0) = 1 + alpha
   L(B, t) = P(t) / P(0) / V(B, t)
