Net Value

The net value of tokens are calculated based on the coupon rate, the elapsed time from last Reset event, and the latest ETH/USD price fed to the system. In particular:

​	NV(A) = 1 + r * N

​	NV(B) = 2 * (P(t) - P(0)) - NV(A)

​	r is the daily coupon rate.

​	N is the number of days from last Reset event.

​	P(t) is the current ETH/USD price.

​	P(0) is the recorded ETH/USD price at last Reset event.

Creation

Class A and Class B tokens can be created by sending ETH tokens to the Custodian contract.
