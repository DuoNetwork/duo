Net Value

The net value of tokens are calculated based on the coupon rate, the elapsed time from last Reset event, and the latest ETH/USD price fed to the system. In particular:

​	NV(A) = 1 + r * N

​	NV(B) = 2 * P(t) / P(0) - NV(A)

​	r is the daily coupon rate.

​	N is the number of days from last Reset event.

​	P(t) is the current ETH/USD price.

​	P(0) is the recorded ETH/USD price at last Reset event.

Creation

Dual-class tokens can be created by depositing ETH tokens to the Custodian contract. Upon receiving ETH, the Custodian contract will return to the sender equivalent amount of Class A and Class B tokens. Such amount N(C) can be calculated by:

    N(C) = M(C) * P(0) * (1 - c) / 2

    M(C) is the amount of ETH sent to the Custodian contract.

    P(0) is the recorded ETH/USD price at last Reset event.

    c is the processing fee of the smart contract.

The deposited ETH are kept by the Custodian contract, as collateral of the Class A and Class B tokens issued by the contract. Any user or member of the public can verify the ETH collateral and tokens issued through third party applications such as Etherscan.io.

Redemption

Holders of Class A and Class B tokens can withdraw deposited ETH at any time by performing a redemption. To do this, the user will send certain amount of Class A and Class B tokens to the Custodian contract. The contract will deduct equal amount of Class A and Class B tokens, and return return to the sender certain amount of ETH. 

The amount N(R) deducted by the contract is:

    N(R) = Min (N(A), N(B))

    N(A) is the amount of Class A sent to the Custodian contract.

    N(B) is the amount of Class B sent to the Custodian contract.

The amount M(R) returned by the contract is:

    M(R) = N(R) * (1 - c) * 2 / P(0)

    P(0) is the recorded ETH/USD price at last Reset event.

    c is the processing fee of the smart contract.
