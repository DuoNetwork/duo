Leverage is the strategy of using borrowed capital to increase the potential return of an investment. Retail investors have less access to leverage methods such as margin loans and financial derivatives, which promoted the creation of leveraged fund products. 

A interesting class of leveraged funds is the dual-purpose funds, also known as primes and scores, which are mutual funds that are split into two classes of shares by design: low risk shares and high risk shares. They were designed to provide investors with the opportunity of repackaging their investment incomes and capital flow in accordance with their preferences. Dual-purpose funds first appeared in U.S. in 1965, but faded out in early 1990s due to a change in the tax code that resulted in double taxation. 

The dual-purpose fund was introduced in China in 2010 and it quickly became the most popular leveraged product there, reaching market size of 500 billion CNY (80 Billion USD) at its peak. A Chinese dual-purpose fund usually takes an open-end index-tracking fund as underlying and has two classes of shares: the low risk A shares behave like a perpetual bond with periodical coupon payments, and the high risk B shares are essentially a closed-end fund magnifying the exposure of the underlying index. A set of upward and downward reset clauses is imposed to reduce the risk of both shares.

We are attracted by Chinese dual-purpose fund for three reasons: (i) both the income and leveraged shares answer unfulfilled demands of cryptocurrency users; (ii) the market mechanism, pricing formula and arbitrage method are proven working in real market; and (iii) the structure can be efficiently implemented by Smart Contracts.
