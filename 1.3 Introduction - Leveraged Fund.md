Leverage is the strategy of using borrowed capital to increase the potential of an investment and is very common for institutions in futures and option markets as they are traded on margin. However, retail investors have much less access to leverage in the broader market, which promoted the creation of leveraged exchanged traded funds to meet the need of retail investors. ProShares launched its first leveraged ETFs in 2006 and the number of leveraged ETFs available now has grown over 200, offering exposures ranging from equities, currencies and commodities. A related class of leveraged funds is the dual-purpose funds, which are mutual funds that are split into two classes of shares by design: low risk
shares and high risk shares. Dual-purpose funds first appeared in U.S. in 1965, but faded out in early 1990s due to a change in the tax code that resulted in double taxation. However, ever since it is introduced to the China market in 2010, it has been the most popular leveraged product there. (1)
