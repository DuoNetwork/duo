Since their inception, crypto currencies aim to create an alternative financial market comparable to fiat financial market. In fiat world, money or value existings in a few different forms: actual currency in circulation and fixed income assets such as time deposits and money market funds, which are the fundation for rest of the financial market to build on. In crypto world, the market is at primative stage as it lacks a comparable coin or token similar to fiat money due to their huge price volatility and thus there is no established fixed income assets either. There has been a few attempts to create stablecoins hoping to address the price volatility issue, but none of them has been successful. For example, Tether requires fiat as collateral and its issuance is centralized; Basecoin relies on economic theories that is not guaranteed to work or may take too long before it is effective; Dai is collateralized by other cryptocurrencies whose prices are also volatile. Most importantly, there is no incentive for crypto investors to hold these stablecoins as they either pays out nothing or is costly to hold. We believe a crypto fixed income asset is a superior solution than exisitng stablecoins to the price volatility issue and it can be the fundation for the crypto financial market.
