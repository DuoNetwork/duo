Since their inception, crypto currencies aim to create an alternative financial system comparable to fiat financial system. In fiat system, money or credits exist in a few different forms: actual currency in circulation and fixed income assets such as time deposits and money market funds, which are the foundation for rest of the financial market to build on. The crypto market is at primitive stage as it lacks coins or tokens comparable to fiat money due to their huge price volatility and thus there is no established fixed income assets either. 

A Stable token, also known as stablecoin, is a crypto-token that keeps stable market value against a specific index, most noticeably US Dollar. There has been a few attempts to create stable tokens: Tether claims to have 1:1 USD collateral in its centralized bank accounts; Basecoin tries to control money supply by playing an algorithmic version of central bank; MakerDAO uses decentralized over-collateralization to maintain confidence of its Dai stablecoin. 

All current stable token designs share a common problem: their holders bear variable levels of counter-party risks, but there is little incentive or even costly to hold these tokens. We believe a crypto-token with stable and increasing value is a superior long-term asset and can improve the robustness of the crypto market.
