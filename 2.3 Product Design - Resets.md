Simply put, the holders of Class B tokens borrow capital from the holders of Class A tokens and invest in a volatile asset (i.e. ETH), which leads the Class B token to possess a continuum of leverage ratios. To reduce risk of both classes, a set of upward and downward reset clauses is imposed.

Contingent Upward

When underlying token price rises, the Class B token's leverage ratio reduces. An Upward Reset is triggered when the Net Value of Class B token reaches upper limit H(B). The reset will restore the leverage ratio to 1 + alpha, and the Net Value of both classes to 1 USD. By increasing Class B's leverage ratio, the structure retains attraction to leverage-seeking users.

Upon Upward Reset, both classes' holders will receive certain amount of underlying token from the Custodian contract.

The underlying token amount M(A) for each Class A token and M(B) for each Class B token:

    U(A) = (V(A, t-) - 1) / P(t)
    U(B) = (V(B, t-) - 1) / P(t)
    V(A, t+) = V(A, 0) = 1
    V(B, t+) = V(B, 0) = 1 

Contingent Downward

When underlying token price falls, the Class B token's leverage ratio increases. A Downward Reset is triggered when the Net Value of Class B token reaches lower limit h. Similar to an Upward Reset, a Downward Reset restores the leverage ratio and Net Value of both classes. By reducing leverage ratio and restoring Net Value, the structure strengtherns principal protection to Class A holders.

Class A holder will receive certain amount of underlying token from the Custodian contract. Additionally, A Downward Reset will reduce the total supply of Class A and Class B tokens by roughly 1 - h. 

The underlying token amount M(A) for each Class A token is:

    D(A) = (V(A, t-) - V(B, t-) * alpha) / P(t)
    Q(B, t+) = Q(B, t-) * V(B, t-)
    Q(A, t+) = Q(B, t+) * alpha
    V(A, t+) = V(A, 0) = 1
    V(B, t+) = V(B, 0) = 1 

    Q(A, t-) and Q(B, t-) are the amount of Class A and Class B tokens right before the Downward Reset.
    Q(A, t+) and Q(B, t+) are the amount of Class A and Class B tokens right after the Downward Reset.

Periodic

When a given time period has passed from the last reset time, V(A, t-) grows to upper limit H(A), a periodic reset is triggered to restore the leverage ratio and net value of both classes. If V(B, t-) is less than 1, reset will be the same as the Contingent Downward reset. Otherwise, reset will be the same as Contingent Upward reset.
