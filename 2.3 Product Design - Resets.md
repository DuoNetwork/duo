Simply put, the holders of Class B tokens borrow capital from the holders of Class A tokens and invest in a volatile asset (i.e. ETH), which leads the Class B token to possess a continuum of leverage ratios. To reduce risk of both classes, a set of upward and downward reset clauses is imposed.

Upward Reset

When underlying token price rises, the Class B token's leverage ratio reduces. An Upward Reset is triggered when the Net Value of Class B token reaches upper limit H. The reset will restore the leverage ratio to (1 + alpha) / alpha, and the Net Value of both classes to 1 USD. By increasing Class B's leverage ratio, the structure retains attraction to leverage-seeking users.

Upon Upward Reset, both classes' holders will receive certain amount of underlying token from the Custodian contract.

The underlying token amount M(A) for each Class A token and M(B) for each Class B token:

    M(A) = (NV(A, t-) - 1) / P(t)
    M(B) = (NV(B, t-) - 1) / P(t)
    NV(A, t+) = NV(A, 0) = 1
    NV(B, t+) = NV(B, 0) = 1 

Downward Reset

When underlying token price falls, the Class B token's leverage ratio increases. A Downward Reset is triggered when the Net Value of Class B token reaches lower limit h. Similar to an Upward Reset, a Downward Reset restores the leverage ratio and Net Value of both classes. By reducing leverage ratio and restoring Net Value, the structure strengtherns principal protection to Class A holders.

Class A holder will receive certain amount of underlying token from the Custodian contract. Additionally, A Downward Reset will reduce the total supply of Class A and Class B tokens by roughly 1 - h. 

The underlying token amount M(A) for each Class A token is:

    M(A) = (NV(A, t-) - NV(B, t-) / alpha) / P(t)
    NV(A, t+) = NV(A, 0) = 1
    NV(B, t+) = NV(B, 0) = 1 
    Q(t+) = Q(t-) * NV(B, t-)

    Q(t-) is the amount of Class A and Class B tokens right before the Downward Reset.
    Q(t+) is the amount of Class A and Class B tokens right after the Downward Reset.
