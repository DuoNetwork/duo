In fiat market, risk segmentation exists in every level of market. At asset class level, risk averse investors choose fixed income products while risk seeking investors choose equity or commodity. Within fixed income market, conservative investors choose safe haven assets such as government bonds while aggressive players choose high yield bonds, or otherwise known as junk bonds. Although most of crypto investors could be classified as aggresive or risk seeking investors, there still exists different segments of investors among this group. The existence of margin trading in a few crypto exchanges demostrates the need of those extremely aggressive crypto investors. Similarly, conservative crypto investors should be satisfied with a crypto based fixed income product that provides stable returns that is lower than the price appreciation but much higher than traditional fixed income products. However, to our best knowledge, there is no such product in the market at the moment. We believe a crypto investment product that can satisfy the need of both conservative and aggressive crypto investor will have huge potential and market.
