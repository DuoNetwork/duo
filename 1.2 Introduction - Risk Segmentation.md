In fiat market, risk segmentation exists in every level of market. At asset class level, risk averse investors choose fixed income products while risk seeking investors choose equity or commodity. Within fixed income market, conservative investors choose safe haven assets such as government bonds while aggressive players choose high yield bonds, or otherwise known as junk bonds. 

Although most of crypto assets are considered highly speculative, there still exist different segments of risk appetites. The existence of margin trading in exchanges like BitFinex and Huobi Pro demonstrates the need of leverage from aggressive crypto investors. Similarly, safe haven assets providing low volatility and stable income will be appealing to institutional players, short-term pessimistic investors and ICO project teams. However, to our best knowledge, there is no viable product at the moment. 

The price volatility cannot be eliminated, but can be transferred. Through a structured contract, a risk-seeking user can get exposed to higher leverage with limited assets, while a risk-averse user can avoid unwanted price fluctuations by entering the other side of the contract. The financial market has created many products satisfying different risk segments, some of which can be very practical for crypto market participants.
