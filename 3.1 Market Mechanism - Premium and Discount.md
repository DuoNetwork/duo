Like all fixed income products, Class A is expected to trade on premium or at discount with respect to its net values, depending on market condition. When Class A trades on premium, that generally indicates market has a higher demand for fixed income and less for leverage and thus investor is actually paying extra for Class A. On the contrary, when Class A trades at discount, that generally means market has higher demand for leverage and less for fixed income and thus investor need to be given more incentives to buy and hold CLass A. Whether Class A trades on premium or at discount has less to do with market sentiment but more to do with cost of funding or required rate of return, as for all fixed income products. Class A reflects market cost of funding in its price premium or discount. As time draws closer to period resets or market level is approaching contigent resets, Claass A would trade close to its net value as that is what investors will receive after resets.
