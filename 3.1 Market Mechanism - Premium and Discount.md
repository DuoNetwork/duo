Like all fixed income products, Class A is expected to trade on premium or at discount with respect to its net value, depending on market condition. When Class A trades on premium, that generally indicates a higher demand for income over leverage and thus Class A buyers are getting lower yield. On the contrary, when Class A trades at discount, that implies a higher demand for leverage over income and thus Class A buyers are paying less and getting higher yield. In an orderly market, Class A's market price can be used to derive the current market cost of funding. As net values draws closer to resets, Class A might trade closer to its net value as trader start exploiting arbitrage opportunities.
