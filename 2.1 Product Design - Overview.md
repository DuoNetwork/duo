DUO is a dual-class token structure that, combined with smart contract governed rules and market arbitrage mechanism, provides principal-guaranteed fixed incomes and leveraged capital gains for holders of each class.

Class A Token, also known as the Income Token, continuously accumulates interests based on its original net value at last Reset event. It will receive token payments at each Reset event.

Class B Token, also known as the Leverage Token, entitles leveraged participation of the underlying digital assets.

The Custodian smart contract performs multiple tasks that facilitate key mechanism of the system, including: creation and redemption of DUO tokens, safekeeping the underlying digital assets (e.g. ETH), calculation of tokens' net values, and execution of Reset events.
